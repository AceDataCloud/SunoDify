# Suno

**Author:** acedatacloud

**Type:** tool provider plugin

**API:** `https://api.acedata.cloud/suno/audios`

## Tools

| Tool ID | Purpose | Inputs |
|---|---|---|
| `suno_generate_audios` | Suno Generate Audios | `prompt`, `model`, `custom`, `lyric`, `title`, `style`, `instrumental`, `duration` |
| `suno_task_retrieve` | Suno Retrieve Task | `task_id`, `wait_seconds` |

Outputs include `status`, `task_id`, `media_urls`, `result`, and the earlier plugin conventions `success`, `trace_id`, `data`. `success` is true only when results are complete; failures raise tool errors.

The credential field is `acedata_bearer_token`; paste the token without the `Bearer ` prefix.

Generate Suno music from descriptions or custom lyrics with Ace Data Cloud. Maintained by Ace Data Cloud. This is a free Dify tool plugin; API use requires your own Ace Data Cloud account and may incur usage charges.

## Setup

1. Sign in at [Ace Data Cloud](https://platform.acedata.cloud/console/applications), activate the service and check [current pricing](https://platform.acedata.cloud/models).
2. Create an API key authorized for this service. A service key is scoped; use a global key only for services your account can access.
3. Install this plugin from Dify Marketplace **after it is published**. During review, source/package tests do not imply official listing. A development package can use Dify's documented remote-debug workflow in an isolated workspace.
4. In Dify **Integrations → Tools** (or **Plugins** in older versions), authorize the plugin with the key. Credential validation makes only a read-only task query; it never generates media.

## Workflow

1. Create **Start → Generate → Output** and select this plugin's generation tool. Fill the required prompt/text, model and options. Disable automatic retries for generation.
2. Save `task_id` from the result. Status `pending` means accepted, not finished.
3. Pass the same ID to **Retrieve or wait for task**. Set **Wait up to seconds** to 120–240 for a bounded wait, or 0 for one read. If it still returns `pending`, wait and query the same ID again. Do not resubmit generation.
4. When `status` is `succeeded`, read `media_urls` for the image/audio/video links. Use **Output** (or Chatflow **Answer**) to return the URLs. Task failures raise a Dify tool error, rather than returning a false success.

For custom mode, supply style and lyrics (lyrics can be omitted for instrumental music). Duration is a target, not a guaranteed track length. Intermediate audio previews are never reported as completed media.

This release covers music generation from descriptions or custom lyrics. Task queries return output fields only, excluding stored requests, account IDs and routing metadata. Generation uses asynchronous requests. Each HTTPS request has a 10-second connect and 60-second read timeout; a wait call polls for at most 240 seconds. No automatic paid retries or model fallback is implemented. On a submission timeout, check request history before attempting another submission.

## Billing, network and privacy

The plugin connects only to `api.acedata.cloud:443`; it does not download reference URLs or media itself. URLs are passed to the API as inputs or returned for downstream use. Only submit content you are authorized to process.

Check [Usage](https://platform.acedata.cloud/console/usages) by key and time after a real call. Charges are in Credits; USD = Credits × your current package price / amount. Dify tool execution counts are not the billing ledger. A completed task must also have usable media. See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md).

Python 3.12 and `dify-plugin==0.9.1` are required. Default models and listed options may change with the service; check the catalog before using a different model. Contact support for access errors; reduce concurrency on HTTP 429. Do not put keys into prompts or exported workflows.

## Earlier Dify plugin conventions

This repository follows the earlier service-specific icon, tool naming, Bearer Token credential, bilingual metadata and code layout. The tool table above defines this release's scope; it does not restore all historical tools or the private fork's release workflows.
