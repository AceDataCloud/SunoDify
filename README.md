# Suno for Dify: step-by-step guide

Generate instrumental music and retrieve the completed audio. This guide takes you from your first API key to the result in a Dify Workflow. Screenshots use Dify CE 1.17.1 in English; later versions may move the same controls.

[Read in Simplified Chinese](https://github.com/AceDataCloud/SunoDify/blob/main/readme/README_zh_Hans.md) · [API and pricing](https://platform.acedata.cloud/models)

## 1. Install the correct plugin

Open [Suno by acedatacloud](https://marketplace.dify.ai/plugin/acedatacloud/suno) in Dify Marketplace. Check the author is **acedatacloud**, choose **Install**, and select your Dify workspace. In your Dify workspace, open **Integrations → Tools → Tool Plugin** and select **Suno**. Its card should say **From Marketplace**.

If your Dify server cannot open Marketplace, ask its administrator to enable outbound access and plugin installation. The plugin needs HTTPS to `api.acedata.cloud`.

## 2. Get an API key with the correct access

1. Sign in at [Ace Data Cloud → Applications](https://platform.acedata.cloud/console/applications).
2. Open **General application**. Its API key can access multiple services your account is entitled to use. A service-specific key is limited to that service. For this tutorial, check **Suno** access and current pricing/balance before generating.
3. To reuse the selected key, click the copy icon marked **1** below. To create a separate Dify key, click **Manage Keys** marked **2**, then **Create**.

![Copy an existing API key or open Manage Keys](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AceDataCloud/SunoDify/8d3d03570e73324220f111f7fe343da0792a8071/_assets/tutorial/get-api-key-en.png)

4. Give the new key a name, such as `Dify tutorial`. Set expiration and usage/API restrictions only as needed, then click **Create**. Return to the key list or application card and copy the key. If **Allowed APIs** is enabled, include both the generation and task-query APIs used here: `/suno/audios`, `/suno/tasks`.

![Create an optional separate key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AceDataCloud/SunoDify/8d3d03570e73324220f111f7fe343da0792a8071/_assets/tutorial/create-api-key-en.png)

Copy only the token string. Do not add `Bearer `, quotation marks, or the screenshot's redacted characters. A platform management token (for example, a `platform-...` token) is not the generation API key this plugin expects. Confirm service access and a sufficient balance before the first run.

## 3. Authorize Suno in Dify

1. Open **Integrations → Tools → Tool Plugin → Suno**.
2. Click **API Key Authorization Configuration**. If an authorization already exists, click **1 Authorization** first, then the configuration button.
3. Enter an **Authorization Name**, such as `Ace Data Cloud`, and paste the copied token into **Ace Data Cloud Bearer Token**.
4. Choose who may use the credential and click **Save**. Never put a key in a prompt or workflow export.

![Dify tool authorization dialog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AceDataCloud/SunoDify/8d3d03570e73324220f111f7fe343da0792a8071/_assets/tutorial/02-authorize.png)

## 4. Build your first Workflow

Open **Studio → Create → Create from Blank → Workflow**, name it, and create this path by dragging from each node's right connector to the next node:

**Start → Suno Generate Audios → Suno Retrieve Task → Output**.

Use the **+** button to add a **Tool**, select this plugin, and choose the exact action above. Rename the generation node **Suno** and the query node **Retrieve completed task** to match the screenshots. Leave Start inputs empty for this fixed first example. Keep **Retry on Failure** off on the generation node.

![Workflow connections](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AceDataCloud/SunoDify/8d3d03570e73324220f111f7fe343da0792a8071/_assets/tutorial/03-workflow.png)

Select **Suno Generate Audios** and set these fields. Leave unmentioned optional fields empty.

| Dify field | First-run value |
|---|---|
| Model (`model`) | `chirp-v6` |
| Instrumental (`instrumental`) | `true` |
| Duration (`duration`) | `10` |

**Prompt** (`prompt`):

```text
A short gentle instrumental piano melody for a sunrise, no vocals.
```

Turn **Instrumental** on for this first run. Duration is a target, not a guaranteed track length. Custom vocal music needs lyrics or a lyric prompt. A playable preview while running is not a final result.

## 5. Wait for the same task and map the result

Select **Suno Retrieve Task**. In **Task ID**, click the variable picker (or type `/`) and choose **Suno → task_id**. It must be the output variable from the generation node, not its name typed as plain text. Set **Wait up to seconds** to `240`; leave Trace ID empty for this example.

![Task ID variable binding](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AceDataCloud/SunoDify/8d3d03570e73324220f111f7fe343da0792a8071/_assets/tutorial/04-task-id.png)

Select **Output**, click **+** to add output fields, and choose the variables below from **Retrieve completed task**:

| Output name | Select from query node | Type |
|---|---|---|
| status | status | String |
| success | success | Boolean |
| task_id | task_id | String |
| media_urls | media_urls | Array[String] |
| result | result | Object |

![Map the query outputs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AceDataCloud/SunoDify/8d3d03570e73324220f111f7fe343da0792a8071/_assets/tutorial/05-output.png)

Click **Test Run → Start Run**. Generation may finish before the bounded wait expires; otherwise `status=pending` is normal. **Do not rerun the whole workflow while it is pending**, because that submits a new generation. Copy its task ID and create a separate **Start → Suno Retrieve Task → Output** workflow with that ID and a wait of 0 or 240. Query the same ID until `status=succeeded` and `success=true`; then open the links in `media_urls`. A green Dify workflow alone is not proof that the service task finished.

## 6. Check the expected output

A completed result has this shape (the URL below illustrates the field; use your own returned URL):

```json
{
  "status": "succeeded",
  "success": true,
  "media_urls": [
    "https://.../result.mp3"
  ]
}
```

![Actual completed Dify result](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AceDataCloud/SunoDify/8d3d03570e73324220f111f7fe343da0792a8071/_assets/tutorial/06-result.png)

Actual run example; your task ID and media URL will differ.

## Troubleshooting

| What you see | What to do |
|---|---|
| Authorization fails / 401 or 403 | Copy the full API token, remove `Bearer `, check service access, balance, expiration and Allowed APIs. |
| Invalid parameter / 400 | Copy the exact example model, action, resolution and JSON shape. Do not combine unrelated action fields. |
| `pending` or an empty media list | Query the same task ID again. Never regenerate just to poll. |
| HTTP 429 | Wait, reduce concurrency and check service limits; do not enable automatic paid retries. |
| Timeout / 5xx / failed task | Inspect the original task or request history before resubmitting. Contact support with task/trace ID, never your key. |
| Media link will not load | Check the task is terminal and the returned link is accessible from the Dify server/browser. |

[Download the ready-to-import workflow](https://github.com/AceDataCloud/SunoDify/raw/refs/heads/main/docs/quickstart.dify.yml). Import it in Studio, then configure your own key; the file contains no credentials.

## Privacy, cost and support

The free plugin sends your chosen inputs and token to `api.acedata.cloud`; API calls follow current service pricing. Keys stay in Dify credential storage. See [Privacy](https://github.com/AceDataCloud/SunoDify/blob/main/PRIVACY.md). Only submit content you have permission to process.

Development and test evidence live in the source repository, separate from this first-run guide.
